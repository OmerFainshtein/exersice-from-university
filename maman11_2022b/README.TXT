PROJECT TITLE: Maman 11
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: I was asked to write 2:
 1. A program that reads from the input the position of a knight on a chessboard and prints all the     places on the board to which the knight can move.
 2. A program that tests threats between three given pieces on the chess board
 I did the assignment by understanding mathematical formulas that exist for threats between certain pieces in chess.
